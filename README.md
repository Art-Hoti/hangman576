## Description
This project is a classic implementation of the Hangman game where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it within a certain number of attempts. The project is developed step-by-step, with each milestone adding new functionality to the game. The aim of the project is to learn and apply Python programming concepts such as lists, conditional statements, loops, and user input handling.

### What I Learned
- Creating and manipulating lists in Python
- Using conditional statements and loops
- Handling user input
- Working with Python's `random` module
- Tracking code changes and collaborating using GitHub

## Installation
To install and run the project locally, these are the steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd hangman-game
    ```
3. **Ensure you have Python installed:**
    Make sure Python 3 is installed. [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

    ## Usage
To play the game, run the `milestone_2.py` script:

1. **Navigate to the directory containing the script:**
    ```sh
    cd /path/to/milestone_2.py
    ```
2. **Run the script using Python:**
    ```sh
    /usr/local/bin/python3 milestone_2.py
    ```
3. **Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the word.**
